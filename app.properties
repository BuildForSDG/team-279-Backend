# this is a simple properties file
# meant to curate important meta data
# about what a team is building
#
# each entry should have a single value
# or a list of comma separated values
#
# this file can be filled incrementally
# since fields like app.urls (links to the deployed solutions)
# might not have been created right now, so you can leave that 
# entry blank till the value is available
#
# the file should be at the root of a repo and should be in all repos
